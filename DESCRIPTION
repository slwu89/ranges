Description: Gives users tools to Make integer ranges for benchmarking algorithms, especially for numerical or 
  scientific computing, that need to be tested on arguments ranging over several
  orders of magnitude. It can generate dense (linear) or sparse (logarithmic) ranges
  and is designed to be used to generate input for benchmarking packages.
